      <p>Your repair will be assessed and fixed by a trade operative. If your repair is complex, it may need more than one repair appointment. If another appointment is needed, we will arrange it after the first one.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before we visit</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Before we visit, we need to know if any vulnerable people will be present at the repair appointment, and any information on access restrictions to the property. </p>

      <p>Things we need to know include:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>If anyone with a medical condition or mobility difficulties lives in the home.</li>
          <li>If you are a carer reporting on behalf of someone else.</li>
          <li>If there are any access restrictions to the property we need to be aware of.</li>
